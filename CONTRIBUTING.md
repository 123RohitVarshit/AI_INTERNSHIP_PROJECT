## How You Can Help

There are many ways to contribute, and all of them are valuable.

### Reporting Bugs

If you find something that isn't working correctly, please open a new issue. Describe the problem as clearly as you can:
-   What did you expect to happen?
-   What actually happened?
-   What steps can I take to reproduce the issue?

### Suggesting Enhancements

Have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one? Open an issue and we can discuss it. I'm always open to new ideas that can make the app better for everyone.

### Contributing Code

If you'd like to write some code, that's fantastic! Hereâ€™s how you can get started:
1.  **Fork the repository** to your own GitHub account.
2.  **Create a new branch** for your changes (`git checkout -b your-feature-name`).
3.  **Make your changes.** Please try to follow the existing code style.
4.  **Test your changes** to make sure everything works as expected.

I'll review the pull request as soon as I can, and we can work together to get it merged.

## A Few Guidelines

-   **Keep it focused:** Try to keep your pull requests focused on a single feature or bug fix.
-   **Communicate:** If you're planning a large change, it's a good idea to open an issue to discuss it first.
-   **Be respectful:** Let's maintain a positive and welcoming environment for everyone.

Thank you again for your help. I look forward to building this platform together!
